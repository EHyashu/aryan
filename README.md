✅ **Now it will look perfect** on GitHub — with bold headers, proper spacing, color-coded code blocks, tables, and emoji touches for visual balance.  
Would you like me to make a **dark-theme badge section** (e.g., “Built with ❤️ using HTML, CSS, JS, and Netlify”) at the top? It adds a modern open-source touch.
